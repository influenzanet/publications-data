We provide the raw number of answers to questions 4, 11a, 12, 13, 14, 16a, 17, 18a, 20, 22a and 24 of the COVIDNET.FR/INFECTIERADAR.BE/INFLUWEB.IT SURVEY ON PROSPECTIVE TESTING AND ISOLATION FOR THE 2022/2023 WINTER. The data was collected over the 2022 summer on the French, Belgian and Italian national platforms of Influenzanet.
The data is stratified by age, gender and education with the following notation: 
age group = {Y = young adult, A = adult, S = senior}, 
gender = {M = male, F = female}, 
level of education = {L = lower, H = higher}.

The age groups considered are [20, 39] (young adult), [40, 59] (adult), 60+ (senior) for France and Italy and [25, 44] (young adult), [45, 64] (adult), 65+ (senior) years-old for Belgium. The groups of level of education are instead <=A-levels (lower) and >A-levels (higher).
